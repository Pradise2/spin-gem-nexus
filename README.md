## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. A great way to manage Node versions is with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    This command will install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`, including React, Vite, Wagmi, and all shadcn/ui components.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    For Web3 wallet connectivity (specifically for WalletConnect), you need a Project ID.
    *   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
    *   Go to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) to create a project and get your Project ID.
    *   Add the Project ID to your `.env.local` file:
        ```
        VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID='YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID'
        ```
    *   Update the wagmi config at `src/lib/wagmi.ts` to use this environment variable.

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080/`. The server features Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so most changes will be reflected in your browser instantly without a full page reload.

## 📜 Available Scripts

This project comes with several pre-configured npm scripts:

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
*   `npm run build`: Compiles and bundles the application for production into the `dist/` directory.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the project's TypeScript/TSX files using ESLint.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build from the `dist/` directory locally to preview before deployment.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a standard Vite + React structure, with key directories organized for scalability.

```

## 🎨 Customization

### Theming

The application's theme and design system are managed through Tailwind CSS and CSS variables.

*   **Colors & Theme**: To change the color palette, modify the CSS variables in `src/index.css`. This file defines the core colors for the background, foreground, primary, secondary, and accent colors.
*   **Tailwind Config**: Advanced customizations, such as adding new animations, fonts, or breakpoints, can be done in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **Components**: Individual component styles can be adjusted directly in the component files located in `src/components/`.
